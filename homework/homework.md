## Homework

Preparatory homework is assigned weekly over a period of 1-month, leading up to bootcamp. The homework assignments prompt students to install required software on their computer and get software accounts setup, connect on communication channels, test their skills to identify knowledge gaps to work on. The homeworks are dated so that they appear in order in the scheudle/calendar features of this page.
