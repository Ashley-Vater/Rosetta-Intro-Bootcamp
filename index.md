# Rosetta Intro Bootcamp PyRosetta & ML-Protein Structure Prediction and Design for New Users

This website organizes the learning materials and content for the Intro to PyRosetta and ML-molecular modeling. This curriculum was developed for the [2023 NSF sponsored Rosetta Research Experience for Undergraduates program](https://rosettacommons.org/about/intern)and will be adpated and itterated for a series of bootcamps in 2023 to different new user audiences. 

**Instructors**: [Deniz Akpinaroglu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/deniz-akpinaroglu-575b1b20b/)
Summer 2023
Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore MD.

**Course Description**: PyRosetta bootcamp is targeted to new protein designers. The learning progression of this bootcamp is broken into two sections (I): (1) Rosetta protein biophysics basics/conceptual fundamentals; (2) PyRosetta structure and syntax (Pose, Score Function, Movers); (3) modeling protocols in PyRosetta (Minimization, Packing and Relaxing); (5) Introduction to Rosetta Community and coding conventions. (II): (1) ML Protein modeling algorithm architecture, training/testing basics, (2) survey of ML-based modeling options (AlphaFold, OpenFold, ColabFold, Metaâ€™s ESM); (3) ML-based protein design (ProteinMPNN) and diffusion models (RFDiffusion). By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to apply their learnings to their protein modeling or design projects to efficiently assess the project and select the appropriate PyRosetta methods, adapt and run PyRosetta packages, troubleshoot common errors, and assess the project and prioritize the most appropriate ML-based methods, adapt and run these packages, and troubleshoot common errors. 

**Prerequisites**: [Python Proficency](https://developers.google.com/edu/python)
