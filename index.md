# Rosetta Intro Bootcamp PyRosetta & ML-Protein Structure Prediction and Design for New Users

This website organizes the learning materials and content for the Intro to PyRosetta and ML-molecular modeling. This curriculum was developed for the [2023 NSF sponsored Rosetta Research Experience for Undergraduates program](https://rosettacommons.org/about/intern)and will be adpated and itterated for a series of bootcamps in 2023 to different new user audiences. 

**Instructors**: [Deniz Akpinaroglu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/deniz-akpinaroglu-575b1b20b/)
Summer 2023
Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore MD.

**Course Description**: This week-long bootcamp is targeted to new protein designers. The learning progression of this bootcamp is broken into two sections. Section I includes: (1) Rosetta protein biophysics basics/conceptual fundamentals; (2) PyRosetta structure and syntax (Pose, Score Function, Movers); (3) modeling protocols in PyRosetta (Minimization, Packing and Relaxing); (4) Introduction to Rosetta Community and coding conventions. Section II includes: (1) ML Protein modeling algorithm architecture, training/testing basics, (2) survey of ML-based modeling options; (3) review of ML-based protein design and protein generation algorithms (e.g ProteinMPNN and RFDiffusion). By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to select and apply appropriate PyRosetta and/or ML-based methods for their projects and troubleshoot common errors. Additionally participants will learn about the Rosetta Commons and the resources and opportunities the community provides, and make new connections with Commons members from outside their own research group. While comprehensive expertise with Rosetta is not achievable in a weeklong program, participants should expect to develop a strong conceptual foundation of the tools and an awareness of the resources and means to expand upon their skills as their projects progress. They will join a network of enthusiastic scientists developing and employing best-in-class tools to tackle human-centered challenges in food, health, and energy.
